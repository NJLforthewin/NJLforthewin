            <p>I have been making playlists for a long time, and mixtapes before that for about thirty years all told, I reckon. I'm fascinated by selection and juxtaposition. In early 2020 I signed up for a Spotify account. It's a limited platform, and a problematic one. But it is also where people gather, and it has been a productive place to imagine and be with a community of listeners.<br> <br>Below are links to my public playlists on Spotify. The playlists are grouped into general categories, though the majority of them really should be under “eclectic.” Favorites are marked with asterisks, and all time faves are marked with double asterisks.</p>

            <h3>LATEST (2022):</h3>

            <p style="text-align: justify;"><em><a href="https://open.spotify.com/playlist/5LdiN0XyyZtZXn8TPSg5mC?si=2c36085b196d4b40&nd=1">turning:</a></em> turning: music from the last two or three years, uptempo mostly, free of genre constraint, unified by the drum. <p style="text-align: justify;"><em><a href="https://open.spotify.com/playlist/5LdiN0XyyZtZXn8TPSg5mC?si=2c36085b196d4b40&nd=1">stars:</a></em> originating in Latin America, a music that happens between a few people gathered around an illegal fire</p>
            <p style="text-align: justify;"><em><a href="https://open.spotify.com/playlist/5LdiN0XyyZtZXn8TPSg5mC?si=2c36085b196d4b40&nd=1">steady on:</a></em> the sweet sounds of Jamaican rocksteady, with a little bit of relevant digression</p>
            <p style="text-align: justify;"><em><a href="https://open.spotify.com/playlist/5LdiN0XyyZtZXn8TPSg5mC?si=2c36085b196d4b40&nd=1">near:</a></em> near: a playlist under the aegis of the solo cello, a line that to me sounds like the black line of a contour drawing</p>
            <p style="text-align: justify;"><em><a href="https://open.spotify.com/playlist/5LdiN0XyyZtZXn8TPSg5mC?si=2c36085b196d4b40&nd=1">season:</a></em> season: the line “you’re not the season you’re in” by the Fleet Foxes is still resounding in my head</p>
            <p style="text-align: justify;"><em><a href="https://open.spotify.com/playlist/5LdiN0XyyZtZXn8TPSg5mC?si=2c36085b196d4b40&nd=1">soledad:</a></em>what began as a voyage around Piazzolla ended up acquiring a number of extraordinary Mediterranean voices.</p>

            <h3>RECENT (2021):</h3>

            <p style="text-align: justify;"><em><a href="https://open.spotify.com/playlist/5LdiN0XyyZtZXn8TPSg5mC?si=2c36085b196d4b40&nd=1">brook:</a></em> favorite Bach pieces for piano (or, rather, played on piano), focusing on his extraordinary legacy as a melodist</p>
            <p style="text-align: justify;"><em><a href="https://open.spotify.com/playlist/5LdiN0XyyZtZXn8TPSg5mC?si=2c36085b196d4b40&nd=1">red room:</a></em> warm contemporary vibes of low-tempo jazz and r&b, with a fair bit of retro and synthwave</p>
            <p style="text-align: justify;"><em><a href="https://open.spotify.com/playlist/5LdiN0XyyZtZXn8TPSg5mC?si=2c36085b196d4b40&nd=1">the angel said:</a></em> a playlist on presence and strangeness, on beauty, patience, and holiness</p>
            <p style="text-align: justify;"><em><a href="https://open.spotify.com/playlist/5LdiN0XyyZtZXn8TPSg5mC?si=2c36085b196d4b40&nd=1">grandes abracos:</a></em> some beautiful Brazilian songs, a sequel to beijos</p>
            <p style="text-align: justify;"><em><a href="https://open.spotify.com/playlist/5LdiN0XyyZtZXn8TPSg5mC?si=2c36085b196d4b40&nd=1">the hundred greatest songs of all time:</a></em> what it says on the tin, a riposte to a parochial list by Rolling Stone</p>
            <p style="text-align: justify;"><em><a href="https://open.spotify.com/playlist/5LdiN0XyyZtZXn8TPSg5mC?si=2c36085b196d4b40&nd=1">unfurl: :</a></em>  a sequence of morning ragas (with one exception), played on a variety of instruments, each raga unfurling from a slow beginning to a more vigorous conclusion; music at vaster and more immersive time scales</p>  
            <p style="text-align: justify;"><em><a href="https://open.spotify.com/playlist/5LdiN0XyyZtZXn8TPSg5mC?si=2c36085b196d4b40&nd=1">extra time:</a></em> not at all “relaxing” jazz, but also not unapproachable; a set of intense and coherently structured improvisations; foreground music, not background</p>
            <p style="text-align: justify;"><em><a href="https://open.spotify.com/playlist/5LdiN0XyyZtZXn8TPSg5mC?si=2c36085b196d4b40&nd=1">tender too:</a></em> a sequel to “tender one,” which is one of my favorites; the bandoneon/drum duo on “todos los recuerdos” is a standout</p>
            <p style="text-align: justify;"><em><a href="https://open.spotify.com/playlist/5LdiN0XyyZtZXn8TPSg5mC?si=2c36085b196d4b40&nd=1">musoya:</a></em> “musoya” is Bambara for “womanliness”—but what is womanliness; a strength that does not deny its softness, says one woman; which is the testimony of these voices—among my most beloved in the whole wide world</p>
            <p style="text-align: justify;"><em><a href="https://open.spotify.com/playlist/5LdiN0XyyZtZXn8TPSg5mC?si=2c36085b196d4b40&nd=1">four moments of the sun:</a></em>  Congolese rumba from the classic period; dedicated to the notion that Lingala is the most beautiful sung language; the playlist title is a reference to the four solar moments of Kongo cosmology: birth, life, death, and rebirth</p>
            <p style="text-align: justify;"><em><a href="https://open.spotify.com/playlist/5LdiN0XyyZtZXn8TPSg5mC?si=2c36085b196d4b40&nd=1">soon as we get out: </a></em> music for the body, mostly 2-step, dubstep and other electronica; I imagine a dark basement club, no sign outside, intense bass, somatic sense-making; follows on from the “endocytosis “playlist</p>
            <p style="text-align: justify;"><em><a href="https://open.spotify.com/playlist/5LdiN0XyyZtZXn8TPSg5mC?si=2c36085b196d4b40&nd=1">blossom: </a></em>  at the beginning of a difficult spring, thinking of that line of Szymborska’s that encourages us to attend to the available good: “forgive me, distant wars, for bringing flowers home.” This playlist has some overlap with “lovingness,” but it’s in airier, somewhat more relaxed mode</p>
            <p style="text-align: justify;"><em><a href="https://open.spotify.com/playlist/5LdiN0XyyZtZXn8TPSg5mC?si=2c36085b196d4b40&nd=1">group therapy: </a></em>  contemporary classical in mostly dirge-like mode; not background listening; composers have found many ways to reach beyond the accommodating and arrive at an intransigent mournfulness; it’s not a mode I’m always in the mood for, but when I am, with patience and good headphones, I find it incredibly consoling</p>
            <p style="text-align: justify;"><em><a href="https://open.spotify.com/playlist/5LdiN0XyyZtZXn8TPSg5mC?si=2c36085b196d4b40&nd=1">lovingness: </a></em>  “jazz” continues to feel like the wrong term for this aspect of our music, for this long conversation around certain instrumental textures, certain harmonic commitments, certain unfinished histories; this playlist alights on each of the last seven decades, and Trane is the sun</p>
            <p style="text-align: justify;"><em><a href="https://open.spotify.com/playlist/5LdiN0XyyZtZXn8TPSg5mC?si=2c36085b196d4b40&nd=1">fresco: </a></em> eight hours for a full day’s work; focally similar to “dream sequence” and “the blue window”; play on shuffle</p>
            <p style="text-align: justify;"><em><a href="https://open.spotify.com/playlist/5LdiN0XyyZtZXn8TPSg5mC?si=2c36085b196d4b40&nd=1">leaf shadow: </a></em>  in awe of how our thing crossed the ocean and retained its coolness; a meditation on Afrolatinidad</p>
            <p style="text-align: justify;"><em><a href="https://open.spotify.com/playlist/5LdiN0XyyZtZXn8TPSg5mC?si=2c36085b196d4b40&nd=1">begin again: </a></em>begin again: an offering at the start of the year, contemplative and searching; an intake of breathg</p>


            <h3>DREAMING:</h3>

            <p style="text-align: justify;"><em><a href="https://open.spotify.com/playlist/5LdiN0XyyZtZXn8TPSg5mC?si=2c36085b196d4b40&nd=1">dream sequence:</a></em>dream sequence*: long ambient playlist inspired by a similar one made by Ryuichi Sakamoto</p>
            <p style="text-align: justify;"><em><a href="https://open.spotify.com/playlist/5LdiN0XyyZtZXn8TPSg5mC?si=2c36085b196d4b40&nd=1">field hospital:</a></em>field hospital: sorrowful ambient contemporary composition</p>
            <p style="text-align: justify;"><em><a href="https://open.spotify.com/playlist/5LdiN0XyyZtZXn8TPSg5mC?si=2c36085b196d4b40&nd=1">the dark fact:</a></em> the dark fact: similar to field hospital in mood, but longer tracks and edgier compositional techniques</p>
            <p style="text-align: justify;"><em><a href="https://open.spotify.com/playlist/5LdiN0XyyZtZXn8TPSg5mC?si=2c36085b196d4b40&nd=1">book of dreams:</a></em> contemporary classical and ECM-style improvisations, very beautiful, see also “blue books”</p>
            <p style="text-align: justify;"><em><a href="https://open.spotify.com/playlist/5LdiN0XyyZtZXn8TPSg5mC?si=2c36085b196d4b40&nd=1">the blue window: </a></em>gentle classical piano, broody soundtracks, and some low key electronics</p>
            <p style="text-align: justify;"><em><a href="https://open.spotify.com/playlist/5LdiN0XyyZtZXn8TPSg5mC?si=2c36085b196d4b40&nd=1">in a zone:</a></em> Tarkovsky homage, from Bach chorale to Russian ballads; music for altered landscapes</p>
            <p style="text-align: justify;"><em><a href="https://open.spotify.com/playlist/5LdiN0XyyZtZXn8TPSg5mC?si=2c36085b196d4b40&nd=1">blue books:</a></em> eclectic melancholy; contemporary classical, with some Asian folk influences</p>
            <p style="text-align: justify;"><em><a href="https://open.spotify.com/playlist/5LdiN0XyyZtZXn8TPSg5mC?si=2c36085b196d4b40&nd=1">endocytosis: </a></em>danceable electronica and percussion, but with a twitchy and chill vibe</p>
            <p style="text-align: justify;"><em><a href="https://open.spotify.com/playlist/5LdiN0XyyZtZXn8TPSg5mC?si=2c36085b196d4b40&nd=1">year:</a></em> algorithmically determined sequence of the tracks I listened to in the awful year 2020; like a hypertrophied version of “dream sequence”; seven hours long but, strangely, it works</p>
