            <p style="text-align: justify;"><em>The Philippines is an overpopulated country there is a lack of family planning and no sex education at all. Which results in a tremendous population explosion. It is difficult for any government to satisfy the need of such a large population with limited resources. Consequently, Poverty increases in the country.<br> <br>I do documentary photography of children living in poverty in the Philippines. There is wide spread poverty in the Philippines, particularly in the “mega cities” such as Manila. These are photos of the children of people who migrated from the countryside to Manila, hoping to find work and looking for a better life. Instead, their children find themselves in worst poverty than before: living of scrap food at garbage sites, hanging and sleeping in the streets because they have no money for housing, doing drugs. These children don’t attend school. There is no work for them. Their lives waste away. There is no perspective, no hope for change. While I was working on this photo essay my story became one about street children who are becoming dependent on a street drug called Paglipad (flying). This drug gave them the feeling of flight. Many of the children in the pictures are high most of the day because solvents are more easily available to them than food. As a consequence, they are severely malnourished. Many die. The problem is widespread. Locals and tourists ignore the street children. by <a href="http://www.randomhouse.com/catalog/display.pperl?isbn=9781400068098">Alexander Conrady</a></em></p>
